To approach this task of implementing a top-down dynamic programming solution for an Optimal Binary Search Tree, here are the step-by-step instructions:

### 1. **Understand the Optimization Problem**
   - **Problem Definition**: 
     You are tasked with finding the most efficient way to construct a binary search tree from a sorted list of keys, given the frequency of searching for each key. The goal is to minimize the overall search cost by arranging the keys optimally. 
     - You will be given the keys and their corresponding frequencies, and the output should be either the minimum cost or the tree structure that achieves this minimum cost.

### 2. **Break Down the Sub-Problems**
   - The key observation is that the problem of building an optimal tree can be broken down into smaller sub-problems: constructing the optimal subtree for various ranges of the list of keys.
   - Letâ€™s define `dp[i][j]` as the minimum cost of constructing an optimal BST for the keys `i` through `j`.
     - **Base Cases**: If `i > j`, then the subtree is empty and the cost is `0`.
     - **Sub-problems**: The idea is to consider each key `k` in the range `i..j` as the root of the subtree. Then, the cost of the subtree is the sum of:
       1. The cost of the left subtree, which involves keys from `i` to `k-1`.
       2. The cost of the right subtree, which involves keys from `k+1` to `j`.
       3. The sum of all frequencies for the keys in the range `i..j`, because every node in the tree has a search cost proportional to its depth.
     - We need to minimize the total cost over all possible choices of `k` for each range.

### 3. **Recursive Definition of the Solution**
   - The recursive formula for the minimum cost of constructing a binary search tree is:
     \[
     dp[i][j] = \min_{i \leq k \leq j} \left( dp[i][k-1] + dp[k+1][j] + \sum_{t=i}^{j} \text{frequency}(t) \right)
     \]
   - **Explanation**: For each range `i..j`, we choose each `k` as the root, compute the cost of the left and right subtrees, and add the total frequency of all keys in the range `i..j`. We then take the minimum over all possible choices of `k`.

### 4. **Identify Base Cases**
   - If `i > j`, the subtree is empty, so `dp[i][j] = 0`.
   - If `i == j`, the subtree contains only one key, so the cost is just the frequency of that key, `dp[i][i] = frequency[i]`.

### 5. **Caching the Results**
   - To implement dynamic programming, you need to cache the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
   - Use a 2D array `dp` to store the minimum cost for each range `i..j`, so that when the same subproblem arises, you can look up the result instead of recomputing it.

### 6. **Recursive Implementation**
   - Implement the recursive solution using the recursive formula from step 3, and ensure you check if a subproblem has already been solved by consulting the `dp` array before performing any calculations.
   - Optionally, maintain another 2D array `root[i][j]` to store the optimal root for each subtree, so that you can reconstruct the actual tree at the end.

### 7. **Reconstructing the Optimal Tree**
   - For extra credit, reconstruct the tree by using the `root[i][j]` array. This array tells you which key is the root for each subtree. Starting with the entire range, recursively build the left and right subtrees using the same approach, and store the tree structure in nested tuples or any other suitable format.

### 8. **Dynamic Programming Solution**
   - Iterate over all possible ranges of keys in increasing order of length (i.e., consider smaller subtrees first and build up to larger subtrees).
   - For each range, compute the minimum cost using the recursive formula and store the result in the `dp` array.

### 9. **Time Complexity**
   - The time complexity of the dynamic programming approach is `O(n^3)` where `n` is the number of keys. This is because for each pair of `i, j`, you need to iterate over all possible roots `k` and compute the sum of frequencies.

### 10. **Output**
   - The final output should be the minimum cost of constructing the optimal binary search tree (stored in `dp[0][n-1]` for a range of `n` keys).
   - For extra credit, output the structure of the optimal tree using the `root` array.

### Example Approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a `dp` array where `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum cost of constructing the optimal tree for keys `i..j`.
   - Create a `root` array where `root[i][j]` stores the root of the optimal tree for keys `i..j`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - Set `dp[i][i] = frequency[i]` for all `i`.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - For each range length from 2 to `n`:
     - For each starting index `i`, set `j = i + length - 1`.
     - For each possible root `k` between `i` and `j`:
       - Calculate the cost using the formula from step 3, and update `dp[i][j]` if a lower cost is found.

4. **Return**:
   - Return `dp[0][n-1]` as the minimum cost, and optionally use the `root` array to reconstruct the tree.

By following these steps, you will successfully implement a top-down dynamic programming solution to the Optimal Binary Search Tree problem.
